# AGC Mockup (Phase 1)

This mockup is slightly modified from the Flutter Skeleton template app. Differences include:

* Elimination of the src/ directory
* Elimination of localization
  * deleted flutter_localization and generate: true from pubspec.yml.
  * deleted i10n.yml file
  * deleted locationization directory
* Eliminated restoration
* Addition of pages for various garden-related functions

## Installation

After downloading, cd into the directory and invoke:

```
flutter run
```

On my platform, that brings up the iOS simulator and the following:

```
% flutter run

## Screenshots

Here are screen shots that illustrate this mockup. We use the flutter_markdown package to provide information on what should appear in a page when we haven't gotten around to actually mocking up the contents.
